Fineman, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, is known for his original and feared mind in modern physics. He is in the forefront of the search for the ultimate constituents of the world. Fineman's father, a New York clothing salesman, encouraged him to confront conventional wisdom. Fineman then talks about how knowing the names of things is useful if you want to talk to someone, but the basic principle of knowing about something rather than just knowing its name is something that you should start to learn. He then talks about how he and his father would have little games, such as pretending to be Martians and looking at things from a new perspective. He also talks about how he did some research on sleep and how it feels to become unconscious. Finally, he talks about how the most enduring legacy from his father was not just learning to question the physical world, but in enthusiasm for the inquiry.\n",

He explains how particles can be arranged into patterns, with each pattern having eight or ten members related by nuclear properties. He then introduces the concept of quarks, which are the smallest constituents of matter, and how they can be used to explain the behavior of particles at low energies. He also discusses the paradoxes of the quark model, such as the fact that it implies that the number of particles inside a proton is infinite.\n",
